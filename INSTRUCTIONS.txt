This GitHub Pages repo serves public-facing AW3 Knowledge Base content only.

Deployment Rules:
1. Only files tagged with `visibility: Public` in YAML frontmatter are surfaced.
2. All assets must reside in /docs/, /pages/, or /sections/ unless templated.
3. CI will block invalid deployments via `public-surfacing-validation.yml`.

No collaboration is permitted.
