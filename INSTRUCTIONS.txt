AW3 GitHub Pages Public Deployment Instructions

1. This repository must remain PUBLIC for GitHub Pages to build and host the site.
2. All internal and system-governed content is managed in a separate PRIVATE repo.
3. Content in this repo is approved via tag-level filtering (Visibility: Public).
4. Do not manually add files that reference internal Systems, Phases, Modes, or Control Index elements.

Deployment is automatic if using GitHub Actions. If deploying manually:
  - Push to the default branch (e.g., main)
  - GitHub Pages will deploy from root or /docs depending on config
